# Your keymap
#
# Atom keymaps work similarly to stylesheets. Just as stylesheets use selectors
# to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate
# keystrokes with events in specific contexts.
#
# You can create a new keybinding in this file by typing "key" and then hitting
# tab.
